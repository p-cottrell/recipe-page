# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). The project involved creating a clean, accessible recipe page using semantic HTML and modern CSS, focusing on typography, spacing, and responsive layout.


## Overview

This is a responsive recipe page featuring a header, a recipe image, prep time details, ingredients list, instructions, and nutrition facts. The design uses a centered container with custom fonts and consistent color schemes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)  
- Flexbox layout  
- @font-face for custom fonts  
- Mobile-first responsive design  

### What I learned

This project improved my understanding of:

- **CSS Custom Properties**: Defining colors in `:root` made color management simpler and consistent across the site.  
- **Global Box Sizing**: Applying `box-sizing: border-box` universally simplified layout calculations and ensured predictable sizing.  
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used flexbox to center and stack page content cleanly and responsively.  
- **Custom Fonts**: Loaded local fonts with `@font-face` for improved typography and aesthetic appeal.  
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of sections, lists, and tables improved accessibility and structure.  
- **Consistent Spacing and Styling**: Modular CSS made the page easy to maintain and scale.
